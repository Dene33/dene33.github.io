## 1. What are the future plans for the Story Generator?

- Integrating user feedback and suggestions to shape the future development roadmap
- Enhancing the way the app is interacting with different LLM AI models to provide even more realistic and immersive behaviour of NPCs
- Adding the option of direct interaction with the world and NPCs (God mode)
- Save/load/export UI

## 2. Is it free?

- There is a free version of the Story Generator for users to experience its capabilities
- And the standalone app which you can buy with a one-time payment. You get everything, including source code and the future updates. Visit the [pricing page]({% link pricing.md %}) for more details on the available options

## 3. What are the differences between the free and paid versions?

Both versions of the Story Generator currently offer the same features. However, the paid version will receive priority updates and support, ensuring timely improvements and bug fixes. Also during high usage periods, the free version may experience slower response times.

## 4. What's the license of the standalone app?

[BSD 3-Clause License (Revised)](https://www.tldrlegal.com/license/bsd-3-clause-license-revised)

## 5. Do I need to provide my own OpenAI key to use the Story Generator?

- **Free version:** <u>No</u>, you don't need to provide your own OpenAI key in the free version (you have such an option though)
- **Paid version:** <u>Yes</u>, you need to provide an OpenAI key in the standalone app. But don't worry, it's super cheap - no more than 1 cent per world iteration on gpt-3.5-turbo. Additionally, you can plug in the LLM that you run locally and enjoy Story Generator without paying OpenAI for requests

## 6. Can I plug Story Generator into my own game/product?

Absolutely! You can do that with the standalone app

## 7. How does the Story Generator work under the hood?

The Story Generator leverages the power of OpenAI's [ChatGPT](https://chat.openai.com/) Large Language Model (LLM). This model interprets user input, generates responses, and drives the behaviour of NPCs within the generated worlds. Below is a diagram that will help you in understanding the overall concept:

## 8. Where can I submit feature requests/bug reports?

If you encounter any issues, have suggestions for new features, or want to report a bug, please [contact me]({% link contacts.md %})

## 9. Do you provide API?

Unfortunately, not yet. Reach out if you need this feature

## 10. Can I use another LLM instead of ChatGPT?

Yes, with the slight adjustments of the code you can use either a different model of ChatGPT or even a completely different LLM

## 11. Are you open to collaboration opportunities?

Yes, I am open to collaboration opportunities. If you have an exciting idea or project that aligns with the Story Generator, please [reach out]({% link contacts.md %})

## 12. Why do you use the one-time payment model? Will I receive future updates?

Yes, you will receive future updates. Subscription-based model doesn't fit this project and I don't quite like it in general. So pay [only once]({% link pricing.md %}) and get everything, including the source code and the future updates.
